8x8x8 LED Cube
We wanted to build something that integrated both hardware and software. 
We decided to construct an 8x8x8 LED cube that uses an arduino to control the lights. 
We therefore created pre-set lights animations and worked on making it so that lighting of the LEDs could be controlled by a Leap Motion.
